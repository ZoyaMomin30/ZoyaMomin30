# 👋 Hi, I'm Zoya!

I'm a passionate **Full Stack Web Developer** who also thrives in the worlds of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. I bring ideas to life through clean, scalable code and intuitive interfaces.

💡 Got a spark of an idea?  
I’ll design it, build it, and make it interactive.  

🎯 Just drop a topic?  
I’ll transform it into a full-blown dynamic website, pixel by pixel, logic by logic.

✨ From sleek frontend experiences to robust backend systems — I enjoy writing efficient, maintainable code that bridges creativity with functionality.
